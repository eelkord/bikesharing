## Project Overview

In this analysis, we explore Tableau, a data analysis and visualization tool which is more popular in today's professional world. It allows data visualization professionals to create assests that are vitually appealling and easy for a nontechnical audience or stakeholder to understand. We create this visualization so clear and so helpful to give a chance to stakeholders to go directly to the results and make decisions.

Tableau will help us by

Providing the tools to create powerful analytic dashboard
Tell a clear story
Can easily share with others In fact, we use three core components like worksheets, dashboard and story to dive in and level up our analysis with the most popular data analytic and visualization too, Tableau.

## Summary:

In fact, we want to use Tableau to create effective visualizations from the Citi Bike data, therefore the key to getting a good visualization—and, really, any good data analysis—is to start with a question. But what is the right question to ask and how do we portray the answer accurately?

However, we need to think critically about which questions are the most important for our analysis. Our opinion can be swayed based on how the data is represented, so we need to consider how our audience will perceive and interpret the results and visualization that we show them.

After identifying the needs and determining the data capacity, we performed the visualization as below, using New York city-bike-sharing data set:

Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Show a symbol map for the most popular bike ride starting and ending locations.
Show the peak hours of bike riding in August 2019.
Show the average trip duration in terms of age.
